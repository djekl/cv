I was employed there as a CSR (Customer Service Representative) in the Handset Faults call cue. I was initially placed there on contract with Addeco and was then offered a contract directly with Orange. During my time at Orange I regularly scored well in the Call Coach Sessions demonstrating good client facing customer service skills and communication. This involved random monitoring of calls which were then scored 1-5 on various sections 5 being the best, in these Call Coach Sessions I was one of the few to score a 5 in my community.</dd>

Another part of my job was to build refurbished computers, as we were also a recycling company for computers and computer components. When I was refurbishing computers I was using a tool called a “Solitaire Turbo” which could clone a hard disk drive from Master to Target in about 5 minutes. This tool also complied with the data protection act of 1988. In addition I designed a new marketing flyer for distribution around the sales floor.<br /><br />PC2U had a sub-division called ‘Inks2U – Direct’. I was involved in the design and production of the shop flyer and web site that generated additional trade across the company.
